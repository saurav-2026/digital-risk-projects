Digital Risk Practice Projects
This repository contains structured practice projects developed to strengthen skills in digital risk observation, documentation, and basic analysis. The work focuses on organizing information clearly, identifying potential risk indicators, and presenting findings in a structured and review-friendly format.

These projects are based on publicly observable content patterns and are intended for learning and skill development purposes only.

## Project 1: Digital Content Risk Observation
Tools Used:- Microsoft Excel
File:- Digital_Content_Risk_Observation.xlsx
Description:
This project involves documenting potential digital content risks using a structured Excel-based observation log. Different types of content are categorized by platform, risk category, and severity level to improve accuracy, consistency, and attention to detail in reporting. The focus is on proper documentation rather than enforcement actions.

## Project 2: Platform-Wise Digital Risk Summary
Tools Used:- Microsoft Excel
File:- Platform-Wise_Digital_Risk_Summary.xlsx
Description:
This project provides a summarized view of digital risk patterns across multiple platforms. Observations are consolidated to highlight common risk categories, severity distribution, and recurring issues. The objective is to practice analytical thinking and present insights in a clear, non-congested format suitable for review and decision-making.
